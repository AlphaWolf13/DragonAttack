# DragonAttack

A simple Dragon fight form game to test my skills. Updated as I have time to play with various features of C# & Windows Forms.


Planned Changes
- Move more of onscreen text info to Text Boxes.
- Test various form options
- Save & Load file for game
- Add new monsters to fight
- More moves to fight
- Add areas to travel (MUD style??)
- Potentially rebuild under UNITY
